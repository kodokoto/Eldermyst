### Creating a branch

When adding a new feature / working on anything to do with the project, please create a new branch. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:

```sh
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

This will create a new branch and switch to it. You can then push this branch to github by running:

```sh
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

### Commiting changes

From here, you can start working on your changes. Please commit often, and use proper commit messages when doing so.

**NOTE**: Always make sure you are on the correct branch before commiting. You can check which branch you are on by running:

```sh
git branch
```

When you are done working on your changes, you can push them to github by running:

```sh
git push
```

### Creating a pull request

Once you have pushed your changes, you can create a pull request on [github](https://github.com).

When creating a pull request, please make sure to add a description of what you have changed, and what you have added. If you are adding a new feature, ideally you should add a screenshot or gif of the feature in action.

if you know what you are doing, you can merge the main branch into your branch to resolve any conflicts. If you are unsure, please assign the review to me. 

Once it has been reviewed, it can be merged into the main branch.
